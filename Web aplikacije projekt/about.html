                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>Just as other top chefs around the world have done, Pablo has opened a restaurant where
                    the
                    craft of making pizzas has reached the highest level. Through innovative cooking techniques and by
                    using
                    sophisticated dough, Pablo's Pizzeria produces crusts that are light and crisp on the outside
                    slightly
                    chewy on the inside. For decades, artisan bread has been given great attention to detail, whereas
                    pizza
                    dough was a standard 2-hour process. Finally, pizza dough is being crafted with the same level of
                    attention as great bread makers of the world have given to their dough.</p>
                <h1>The Preparation</h1>
                <h3>dough</h3>
                <p>Our artisan style pizza dough is light but not flat; substantial but far from bready, with a light
                    and pillowy crust that's equal parts chewy gluten and air.</p>
                <h3>a word about our crust:</h3>
                <p>Due to the extreme temperature of our oven, the crust will develop a charred exterior. The blackened
                    appearance is sometimes confused as being burnt, however, this charred effect actually enhances the
                    pizza, giving it a smoky, caramelized flavor.</p>
                <h3>toppings</h3>
                <p>The toppings used at Pizzeria Vivace are of the same high quality used at the best gourmet
                    restaurants around the country. An example of these fine ingredients is notable by the cheese that
                    is presented at our tables: Locatelli Pecorino-Romano (Italy's finest)</p>
